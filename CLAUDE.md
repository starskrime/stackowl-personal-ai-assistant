# CLAUDE.md

Rebuilt from what work in this repo has actually needed. Add a line only when it has
been earned — something non-obvious that cost time or nearly caused damage. Keep it
short; the previous version grew to 180 lines and was cleared on 2026-08-10.

## Read these first

`progress.yml` is the state of record — `current` says where we are. Then
`docs/reference-mapping/PROCESS.md` (the method) and `DOC_STANDARD.md` (what every
document must contain). They carry the working rules; this file only holds what they
do not.

## Landmines

**Never run `graphify update` or `graphify hook install`.** Both were tried and
rejected: the packaged incremental path collapses a 12k-node graph to under 700 on a
single-file change, and `update <path>` writes to `<path>/graphify-out/` instead of the
repo-root graph this project uses. The PreToolUse hook actively suggests `graphify
update` when the graph is stale — **ignore that suggestion.** To refresh, re-run
`/graphify src` manually. Confirmed still live 2026-08-11: the hook fired repeatedly
across a full session.

**`graphify query` is oriented at `src/` only.** It cannot answer questions about
`progress.yml`, `docs/`, or `tests/`, and on a broad question it returns ~1,100 nodes,
which is worse than useless. Use it for "where does X live in src", not for everything.

**Never a full `pytest` run** — it hangs on this box. Targeted paths with timeouts.
A hanging test is a failing test.

**Restart with `./start.sh`, then verify via `~/.stackowl/logs/stackowl.jsonl`, never a
PID.** A deletion is not live until the process holding the old code is gone. Check the
core's start time against your last commit before believing anything you measure.

## Logging

Named loggers via `stackowl.infra.observability` (`log.tool`, `log.engine`,
`log.memory`, `log.gateway`, …), 4-point on every `execute()`, and every `except` logs.

**Production runs at INFO. A `log.*.debug` line does not exist when you need it.** This
is not a style note: D08.1's fourth acceptance check sat open for days because its only
evidence line was DEBUG, and no volume of live traffic could ever have closed it. If a
log line is the evidence for a claim, it must be INFO — and run the query that would
close the claim *before* you need it, to confirm it returns something.

## The shapes that account for nearly every real defect here

1. **A write with no reader**, or an actuator wired on only some paths. Measure the
   EFFECT, never trust the call.
2. **Test doubles that stopped resembling the real thing.** Generate fixtures from the
   same constants the code uses where you can.
3. **Two copies of one rule.** One source; have the other ask it.
4. **No decay.** Anything that only appends will poison its reader. And when you remove
   a writer, ask what was *bounding* — or *triggering* — the thing it fed.
