"""ClarifyGateway — in-memory pending-clarify registry + per-channel delivery.

Two pause modes share one registry:

* **Blocking-await (PRIMARY).** :meth:`ask` is called with ``blocking=True``; an
  :class:`asyncio.Event` is created on the entry BEFORE delivery and the tool
  parks on :meth:`wait_for_answer` mid-turn. When the user's reply arrives the
  gateway loop calls :meth:`try_resolve`, which writes the answer onto the entry
  and SETS its event — waking the parked waiter IN THE SAME TURN. The concurrent
  gateway loop (send decoupled from receive) is what frees the loop while a tool
  is parked.
* **Turn-yield (FALLBACK).** :meth:`ask` with ``blocking=False`` (the default)
  records a :class:`PendingClarify` with NO event and the turn ends — no
  coroutine is parked. The gateway loop calls :meth:`try_resolve` on the next
  inbound message; the matching entry is popped and that message becomes the
  answer to a fresh resume turn.

:meth:`try_resolve` matches the first non-expired entry for BOTH ``session_id``
AND ``channel``. Pop ownership is split by mode so resolution is
ORDER-INDEPENDENT (resolve-before-park AND park-before-resolve both deliver the
answer): a TURN-YIELD entry (no event) is popped by ``try_resolve``; a BLOCKING
entry (event present) is NOT popped by ``try_resolve`` — it only writes the
answer + sets the event and leaves the entry in ``_pending`` so a not-yet-parked
:meth:`wait_for_answer` can still find it by id. For blocking entries the WAITER
owns the pop. The router distinguishes the two modes by inspecting the returned
entry's ``event``: a non-``None`` event that is now *set* means a blocking
waiter was/will be woken in-turn (the router must NOT start a fresh turn); a
``None`` event means a turn-yield resume.

Invariants (party-mode E5 review — INC-1..4, B1/B2/B3, Security):

* **Cap one pending per session.** A new ``ask`` for a session that already has
  a pending entry REPLACES it (logged), never accumulates. Bounds per-session
  state and matches the single-pending-clarify MVS rule.
* **session+channel binding is enforced inside ``try_resolve``** — never
  bypassable at a higher layer. A mismatched channel or session returns ``None``
  and leaves the entry intact (prevents the cross-session answer leak, INC-3).
* **TTL-bounded.** :meth:`sweep_expired` drops entries older than a TTL so a
  much-later unrelated message is not mis-resolved as an answer.
* **Self-healing.** No public method raises — delivery failures, missing
  adapters, and unexpected errors degrade to a logged no-op/false return so the
  pipeline keeps running.

Clock-injectable (``time_fn``) so TTL/expiry tests do not sleep. Provenance:

          owns the pop. The set event remains the gateway-loop router's signal
          that this was a blocking (in-turn) resolve.
        * **TURN-YIELD entry** (``match.event is None``): POP and return, exactly
          as before — there is no parked waiter, so the next-message resume folds
          the popped entry's question + reply into a fresh turn.

        Both keys are enforced HERE and are never bypassable (Security INC-3): a
        mismatched channel or session leaves the entry intact and returns
        ``None``.

        Idempotency: for a turn-yield resolve a second call returns ``None`` (the
        entry was popped). For a blocking resolve the entry lingers until the
        waiter pops it; a SECOND reply in that tiny window re-matches the same
        entry and re-sets it with the new answer (benign — the event is already
        set, the waiter is already woken and reads whichever answer is current).
        Once the waiter pops, a further call returns ``None``. Never raises.
